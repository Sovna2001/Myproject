             Nature is what we see and feel around us. A nature is made of ewerything we see around us- tree, 
              flowers, plants, animals, sky, mountains, forests and more. Human being depend on nature to stay alive.
             Nature helps us breathe , give us food , water , shelter , medicines , and clothes. We find many colors in nature which make the Earth beautiful . 
             Great lengths of mountains, thriving ecosystems, the ever- spreading sky thogether with the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere 
             create a saga called "nature". Rich both in terms of its scenic beauty and replenishing resources, nature 
             accounts for supporting life in different shapes forms on our planet.
             Nature is the creation of natural material and physical orld on earth independent of the humam activities. The beauty and richness of nature is diverse and massive.
             Nature provides us with seveal delicacies to enjoy and is our life support system. Our basic needs like food, shelter, water and air are all the gifts from nature.
             Humans have a strong connection and interrealation with nature. Escaping away in the nature heals the mind and body and soothes our soul. 
             Irrespective of what nature prvides us it is also our moral and social responsibility to nurture nature.
